# ITAI1378_ComputerVision_JadeSanchez_Portfolio
Final Portfolio 1378
This portfolio is a summary of my activities in the course ITAI1378 where important principles and practices of artificial intelligence including hands-on projects were studied in depth. Specifically, it covers the following parts, which are designed to include the aims and methodology and outcomes of the following modules- Neural Network Experiments, Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Climate Tweets, and Text-to-Image Synthesis.

The repository is arranged in such a way that it is easy to use: each folder contains accompanying documentation, the codes developed, and images related to the specific assignments. For the duration of this course, I have become familiar with Python, Tensorflow playground, and Github among other things such as reinforcement learning, responsible AI, and text preprocessing techniques.

This has provided me with comprehensive set of skills and knowledge required to navigate the contemporary landscape of AI and its practical issues, thus, opening the way for many more developments and researches in the future.
